# Movie Rater
Startup application for BYU CS 260

## Elevator Pitch:
Have you ever been faced with the question of “What is your favorite movie?” or even “What are some of your favorite movies?”  When this question comes up, my mind typically goes blank and I seem to forget every movie I’ve ever seen.  With the Movie Rater app, you’ll be able to keep track of the movies you watch and how highly you rated them on a 10 star rating system.
